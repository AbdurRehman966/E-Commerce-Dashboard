# E-Commerce-Dashboard
I created a detailed Power BI dashboard using E-Commerce data from Amazon, Home Depot, Shopify, and Walmart. Integrated Sales, Date, and SKU Details tables, utilized DAX for advanced calculations, and created visualizations, including line charts, bar charts, column charts, pie charts, slicers, and map charts. Enhanced data representation through calculated measures for insightful business analytics.
